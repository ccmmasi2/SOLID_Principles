SOLID
Liskov substitution principle. (Liskov was who created this principle)
This principle says: 
	The derived clases could be replaceables by their base clases without altering the operation of the system

Now we have created single interfaces for each operation, and our ObjectRepository can heritate only for specific interfaces
